Where is this data imported into the database?
---------

Have a look in the api/load.py method. It follows the tutorial from
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/ref/contrib/gis/tutorial/ in 
order to get the data fromt he shape file into the PostGIS database
(using the same data format as the GeoDjango model).

What is in the "filtered" subdirectory?
---------

There are some points which don't have valid WKT points in them. If 
you were to inspect the items using:

	ogrinfo -al Aut_support.shp

you'd see some points with the value "POINT( too_big, too_big )". In
order to ensure that the only points in the shape file are those with 
reasonable points, the following command will copy the shapefile, 
excluding all points which don't have a lat/long between -360 and 360.

	ogr2ogr -spat -360 -360 360 360 ./filtered/Aut_support.shp Aut_support.shp
